### This is a hypothetical examination of a typical data center environment based on my 10+ years working in facilities as a data scientist. 
### This examination performed in R looks at trends that one might see when examining temperature trends in a data center. 

## We Examine
* Differences between Isle and inlet temperature
* Rack location within a row and the influence on temperature
* Does location influence temperature differential between isle and inside a server
* What are the differences among temperatures for various server platforms, and their location in the isle?
